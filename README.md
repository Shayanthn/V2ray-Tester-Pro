## 📖 About The Project

This isn't just another config tester. It's a comprehensive, multi-protocol, and high-performance solution built for power users and developers. It automates the entire lifecycle of V2Ray/Xray configurations: from discovering sources and fetching thousands of configs to running detailed performance benchmarks and exporting the best ones. With both a sleek GUI and a feature-rich CLI, it adapts to your workflow.

Developed with an enterprise-level architecture, it features **adaptive testing**, **Telegram bot integration**, and **advanced security validation** to ensure you always have the fastest and most reliable connections.

## ✨ Key Features

  - **🛡️ Multi-Protocol Support:** Natively handles `VMess`, `VLESS`, `Trojan`, `Shadowsocks`, `TUIC`, and `Hysteria2`.
  - **🚀 Advanced Performance Testing:** Measures real-world latency, jitter, and download/upload speeds (Mbps).
  - **🤖 Cross-Platform GUI:** An intuitive and responsive graphical interface built with PyQt6, featuring advanced filtering, sorting, and context menus.
  - **💻 Powerful CLI:** A rich command-line dashboard for automated environments and terminal lovers.
  - **🌐 Smart Source Discovery:** Aggregates config sources and direct subscription links automatically.
  - **⚙️ Adaptive Testing Engine:** Dynamically adjusts test batch sizes and sleep intervals based on success rates to maximize efficiency.
  - **🔔 Telegram Integration:** Control the tester and receive results directly via a Telegram bot.
  - **🔒 Enhanced Security:** Validates URIs and configs against blacklists and malicious payloads.
  - **📄 Flexible Exporting:** Export working configs as plain text, Base64, or JSON.
  - **🌍 Geo-IP Location:** Automatically detects and displays the server's country and flag.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting the tester up and running is quick and easy.

### Prerequisites

  - **Python 3.8+** and `pip` must be installed on your system.
  - The **`xray.exe`** (for Windows) or `xray` (for Linux) core is **already included** in this repository, so you don't need to download it separately.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shaynthn/v2raytesterpro.git
    cd v2raytesterpro
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be created containing the imported libraries.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *The necessary libraries include `aiohttp`, `psutil`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `PyQt6`, `rich`, and `python-telegram-bot`.*

## ⚡ How to Run

You can run the application in either GUI mode (default) or CLI mode.

### 🖥️ GUI Mode

For the full visual experience with all features at your fingertips, simply run the main script:

```sh
python main.py
```

*(Assuming your main script is named `main.py`)*

### ⌨️ CLI Mode

For automation, remote servers, or a terminal-based workflow, use the `--cli` flag:

```sh
python main.py --cli
```
